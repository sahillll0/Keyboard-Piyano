## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```

2. Open the project:
   Just open `index.html` in your browser — no backend required!

## 🧠 How It Works

* Each piano key is mapped with a `data-key` attribute
* JavaScript listens for:

  * `click` events
  * `keydown` events
* When a key matches the user's input, it plays the corresponding audio file
* A short animation is applied for UI feedback

## 🧪 Example Keyboard Mapping

| Keyboard Key | Piano Note |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| A            | C          |
| S            | D          |
| D            | E          |
